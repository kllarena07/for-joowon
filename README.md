revolutionary new technology that turns any image into obama

# How to use

**Use the ui at the top of the window to control the animation, choose between saved transformations, and generate new ones.** All your transformations are saved in the `presets` folder next to the executable. I have no idea why you would ever want to do this, but if you want to transform your images to something other than obama, you can change the `target.png` and `weights.png` files in the same directory.

> `weights.png` is a grayscale image that decides how much importance is given to that pixel being accurate in the final image.
> `target.png` is the image that you want to transform your source image into.
> These images need to be the same size, square, and if you make them much larger than 128x128 pixels the result might take hours or even days to generate.
